model:orch_or,MODEL,Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Penrose/Hameroff),Consciousness arises from quantum computations in microtubules (Hameroff) collapsing via objective reduction in spacetime geometry (Penrose). Controversial but testable: predicts specific quantum effects in neuronal microtubules. Anesthetic binding to microtubules correlates with loss of consciousness. Recent work: Bandyopadhyay found quantum resonance in microtubules at room temperature.,2026-02-17T18:49:17.986001,,Silver,C2,MIND,
model:kastrup_idealism,MODEL,Analytic Idealism (Kastrup),Consciousness is the sole ontological primitive. Matter is what consciousness looks like from the outside (extrinsic appearance of intrinsic experience). Dissolves hard problem: experience does not arise from non-experience. Published in peer-reviewed philosophy journals. Provides rigorous philosophical framework for consciousness-first position.,2026-02-17T18:49:17.986001,,Silver,C2,MIND,
