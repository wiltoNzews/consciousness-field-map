# NDE Peer-Reviewed Literature Research

Research compiled for consciousness-field-map knowledge graph integration.

## Tier 1 Papers (Top journals, impossible to dismiss)

### van Lommel et al. (2001) - The Lancet
- 344 cardiac arrest survivors, 18% reported NDEs
- No physiological variable predicted NDE occurrence
- Prospective design eliminated confabulation

### Parnia et al. AWARE I (2014) - Resuscitation
- 2,060 cardiac arrests, 140 survivors, 9% NDEs
- 1 verified out-of-body perception during 3-minute cardiac arrest

### Parnia et al. AWARE II (2023) - Resuscitation
- 567 cardiac arrests, 53 survivors
- EEG activity consistent with consciousness re-emerged 35-60 min into CPR
- 39.3% reported cardiac arrest memories/perceptions

### Greyson (1983, 2003) - JNMD, General Hospital Psychiatry
- NDE Scale: validated 16-item instrument, used in all subsequent studies
- 10% of cardiac arrest patients reported NDEs
- 100+ peer-reviewed papers, 9,000+ citations

### Mashour et al. (2019) - Alzheimer's & Dementia
- Terminal lucidity: patients with destroyed brains suddenly become lucid
- NIA (National Institute on Aging) backed
- "Challenges current assumptions about neurobiology of severe dementias"

### Griffiths et al. (2016) / Ross et al. (2016) - J Psychopharmacology
- Psilocybin for end-of-life anxiety in cancer patients
- 80% sustained clinical improvement at 6 months
- Mystical experience quality predicted outcome, not dose

### Timmermann et al. (2018) - Frontiers in Psychology
- DMT produces phenomenology statistically indistinguishable from NDEs
- Within-subjects placebo-controlled, Imperial College London

## Tier 2 Papers

### Ring & Cooper (1997/1999) - Blind NDEs
- 31 blind participants, 14 blind from birth
- Congenitally blind report visual NDEs with veridical details

### Nahm et al. (2012) - Archives of Gerontology & Geriatrics
- 81 terminal lucidity cases
- Patients with years of no speech suddenly become lucid before death

### Stevenson/Tucker - UVA DOPS
- 2,500+ cases of children reporting verified past-life memories
- 70% of cases verified against historical records
- JAMA review: "evidence difficult to explain on any other grounds"

## Counter-Evidence (Know These)

### Borjigin et al. (2013) - PNAS
- Gamma surge in dying rats (30 seconds)
- Counter: surges last seconds, not minutes-long NDE narratives
- Human follow-up (Xu 2023): only 2 of 4 patients, neither reported experience

### Blackmore (1993) - Dying Brain Hypothesis
- NDEs = anoxia + endorphins + random firing
- Countered by: van Lommel (no anoxia correlation), NDEs in non-life-threatening situations

## Evidence Structure for the Paper

1. The anomaly is real (van Lommel, Parnia, Greyson)
2. Standard explanations fail (Fenwick, van Lommel)
3. Terminal lucidity independently confirms (Mashour, Nahm)
4. Cross-modal evidence converges (Timmermann, Ring, Stevenson)
5. Filter/transmission model explains all of these
