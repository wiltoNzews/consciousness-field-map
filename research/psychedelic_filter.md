# Psychedelic Consciousness Research - Filter Evidence

Research compiled for consciousness-field-map knowledge graph integration.

## The Core Finding

Every prediction from the filter/receiver model is confirmed.
Every prediction from strict physicalism is contradicted.

## Key Papers

### Carhart-Harris et al. (2012) - PNAS
- Psilocybin DECREASES brain activity while EXPANDING consciousness
- First paper to show this inverse relationship
- "The subjective effects of psychedelics are caused by decreased activity"

### Carhart-Harris & Friston (2019) - Pharmacological Reviews
- REBUS model: Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics
- Psychedelics relax top-down priors (loosen the filter)
- Formally connects free energy principle to psychedelic experience

### Schartner et al. (2017) - Scientific Reports
- Lempel-Ziv complexity ABOVE normal waking for ketamine, LSD, psilocybin
- First time ANY condition exceeded waking on validated consciousness index
- "More conscious than sober" - measurably

### Petri et al. (2014) - J Royal Society Interface
- Psilocybin creates new functional connections between normally isolated brain regions
- Not "more activity" - LESS CONSTRAINT on connectivity
- The iconic visualization: organized brain vs. interconnected web

### Daws et al. (2022) - Nature Medicine
- Psilocybin increases global brain integration in depression
- Escitalopram (SSRI) does NOT
- Depression = filter too tight; psilocybin loosens it

### Carhart-Harris et al. (2016) - PNAS
- LSD: three neuroimaging modalities (ASL, BOLD, MEG)
- DMN disintegration correlates with ego dissolution
- Brain becomes less modular, less constrained

### MacLean et al. (2011) - J Psychopharmacology
- Single psilocybin session permanently changes personality (Openness)
- Change larger than decades of normal life
- Only in those who had "complete mystical experience"

### Nour et al. (2016) - Frontiers in Human Neuroscience
- Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI) validated
- Ego dissolution predicts mystical experience (rho = 0.735)
- Quantifies the filter-relaxation experience

### Roseman et al. (2018) - Frontiers in Pharmacology
- Experiential quality predicts 54% of therapeutic variance
- Not dose, not pharmacokinetics - the EXPERIENCE itself heals
- The drug opens the valve; what comes through does the work

### Timmermann et al. (2018) - Frontiers in Psychology
- DMT phenomenology indistinguishable from NDEs
- Two different conditions (flooding with tryptamine vs. brain shutdown)
- Both compromise the filter -> same experience comes through

### Mitchell et al. (2021) - Nature Medicine
- MAPS MDMA Phase 3: 67% no longer met PTSD criteria
- MDMA creates safety conditions for reconsolidation
- Same 4-step architecture: Safety -> Reduce filter -> Contact -> Integrate

### Ly et al. (2018) - Cell Reports
- Psychedelics promote neuroplasticity (dendrite growth, synapse formation)
- The mechanism by which temporary filter-opening becomes permanent filter-recalibration

## The Synthesis Table

| Finding | Physicalist Prediction | Filter Prediction | Observed |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Brain activity during expanded consciousness | Increases | Decreases | **Decreases** |
| DMN coherence during ego dissolution | Increases/stable | Decreases | **Decreases** |
| Neural signal diversity | Below/equal to waking | Above waking | **Above waking** |
| Brain network modularity | Maintained/increased | Decreased | **Decreased** |
| DMT vs NDE phenomenology | Different mechanisms | Same filter removal | **Same** |
| Therapeutic mechanism | Pharmacological | Experiential | **Experiential** |
| Duration of change vs drug half-life | Proportional | Independent | **Independent** |
| Effect of complete ego dissolution | Pathological | Therapeutic | **Therapeutic** |

Every row goes to filter. Not one goes to strict physicalism.
