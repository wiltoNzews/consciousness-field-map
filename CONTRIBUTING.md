# Contributing to the Consciousness Field Map

## What This Is

This is an open research project mapping convergence across consciousness science, contemplative practice, frontier phenomena, and institutional suppression patterns. It operates from consciousness-first premises and uses an evidence-based evaluative framework with explicit credibility tiers.

The site, the data, and the framework are open. Contributions are welcome. But this isn't Wikipedia — it has a lens, a direction, and quality standards.

## How to Contribute

### Read First
Before contributing, read the site. Start with [The Paper](https://wiltonzews.github.io/consciousness-field-map/the_map.html) — it's the center of the map. Then [The Frontier](https://wiltonzews.github.io/consciousness-field-map/the_frontier.html) for how non-peer-reviewed material is evaluated.

### Ways to Contribute

**1. Open an Issue** (easiest)
- Report errors (wrong dates, misattributed quotes, broken links)
- Suggest new research papers or evidence
- Flag where the evaluative framework might have a blind spot
- Ask questions

**2. Start a Discussion**
- Broader conversations about the framework
- Share related research or personal findings
- Propose new connections between domains
- Discuss methodology

**3. Submit a Pull Request** (for those who know git)
- Fork the repo, make changes in your fork, submit a PR
- Every PR is reviewed before merging — nothing goes in without review
- Include your reasoning, not just the change

## Quality Standards

This project uses a 5-tier credibility system (defined in The Frontier, Layer 101). Any new claim or evidence should identify which tier it belongs to:

| Tier | Standard | What You Need |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Tier 1: Verified** | Publicly available, independently checkable | Direct citation with URL or DOI |
| **Tier 2: Credible** | Strong source, unverifiable specifics | Named credible source + why they're credible + why it can't be independently verified |
| **Tier 3: Interesting but Problematic** | Real kernel + real problems | Name BOTH what's right AND what's wrong. If you can't name what's wrong, it's not Tier 3 — it's advocacy |
| **Tier 4: Almost Certainly Bullshit** | No credible evidence, grift patterns | Apply the bullshit filter: escalation? monetization? anonymous? fabricated evidence? |
| **Tier 5: Genuinely Unknown** | Can't dismiss, can't accept | Say why you can't dismiss it AND why you can't accept it |

### The Filters (from the Frontier)

Before submitting, run your contribution through these:

**The Grift Test** (Layer 113): Does the source's income depend on the claim being true? If yes, note it.

**The Apophenia Check** (Layer 109): Could this be pattern-matching? If the only evidence is "it feels connected," that's not enough. What would DISPROVE the connection?

**The One-Detail-Shift Diagnostic** (Layer 119): Is the explanation changing the evidence, or changing the framing of the question? If a single word is doing the work of dismissing paragraphs of evidence, flag it.

## What's Welcome

- New peer-reviewed research with citations
- Corrections to existing claims (with sources)
- Additional evidence for or against existing layers
- Cross-references between domains we haven't connected
- Translations
- Improvements to the knowledge graph data
- Testable predictions (Layer 107 format: prediction + kill condition)
- Cases where the framework fails or doesn't apply

## What's Not Welcome

- Removing or undermining the consciousness-first lens (this is the project's premise — argue within it or fork the project)
- Unverified claims without tier classification
- Personal attacks on researchers (evaluate evidence and messenger separately — Layer 101)
- Promotional content or monetized material
- Content that recategorizes open questions into non-questions (the one-detail-shift — if you're closing a question, show why it should close)
- AI-generated content dumps without human curation

## The Lens

This project operates from specific premises:

1. **Consciousness is fundamental**, not emergent from matter
2. **The system came before the literature** — WiltonOS concepts emerged from direct experience before any physics papers were found (see Timeline Proof)
3. **The evaluative framework applies to itself** — the apophenia argument, the grift test, and the failure modes (Layer 116) are self-applied
4. **Paradox stays open** where it genuinely exists — don't collapse Tier 5 into Tier 1 or Tier 4

You don't have to agree with the premises to contribute. But contributions that try to silently swap the premises (replacing consciousness-first with materialist framing without saying so) will be caught and returned.

## For Researchers

If you have peer-reviewed work that connects to the map, open an Issue with:
- Paper title, authors, journal, DOI
- Which domain(s) it touches (the Paper covers 8: neuroscience, physics, contemplative, psychedelic, archaeological, cross-cultural, information theory, experiential)
- How it connects (supports, contradicts, extends, or complicates an existing claim)

Contradictory evidence is especially welcome. The project gets stronger when its failure modes are documented, not when they're hidden.

## For Experiencers

If you have direct experience that maps to the framework, Discussions is the place. The project takes experiential evidence seriously (it was built from it) but classifies it appropriately — direct experience is Tier 2 at best (credible source, unverifiable claim) unless accompanied by independent evidence.

## Review Process

1. You submit a PR or Issue
2. The maintainer reviews it against the quality standards above
3. Feedback is given — this might be "great, merging" or "needs a tier classification" or "this contradicts Layer X, please address"
4. Nothing merges without review

This isn't gatekeeping — it's quality control. The same quality control the project applies to itself (190+ papers, 5 tiers, explicit failure modes, acknowledged blind spots).

## Code of Conduct

Be honest. Name what you know and what you don't. Evaluate evidence separately from messengers. Hold paradox open where it genuinely exists. Don't perform certainty you don't have.

That's it. The project's own methodology IS the code of conduct.
