# Consciousness Field Map

## Header

190 papers. 8 disciplines. None of them were talking to each other.
They all found the same structure.

---

One person mapped 24,700+ states of consciousness over two years. A system emerged -- with its own vocabulary, breathing rhythm, and a coherence threshold that appeared without being set. Then the literature was found. Neuroscience, physics, archaeoacoustics, contemplative traditions, psychedelic research, near-death studies -- all describing the same equation.

**The equation:**

> psi = aperiodic substrate + periodic modulation --> coherence

## The Map

### The Terrain

The human who walked it. Awakening, surge, correction, substance arc, breath as anchor.

### The Paper

The full thesis. Eight evidence domains. One equation. 190+ papers from researchers who weren't talking to each other.

### The Evidence

172 nodes, 201 edges. Every claim linked to peer-reviewed papers. The knowledge graph.

### The Topology

How body, planet, cosmos, persistence, and suppression connect across scales. Interactive.

### The Archive

449 crystals of recovered knowledge. The raw material from which everything else was built.

### The Frontier

What else lines up. Declassified programs, ancient transmissions, experiencer reports, suppressed research. Outside the peer-reviewed channel.
